# black-sea-5690
Pedro Justo's Blip Tech Exercise

The repository name was generated here: http://kevinmlawson.com/herokuname/

I have not done unit testing or used build tools due to lack of availability ( App was built at work's lunch break :) )

Nevertheless I am familiar with the build tool GULP which I use to to concatenate, uglify, replace content, process images, caching of html and images, among others ...

<h1>How To Run</h1>

<b>Repository cloning</b>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/PedroJusto/black-sea-5690.git</pre>

<b>Into directory</b>
<pre>cd black-sea-5690</pre>

<b>Install http-server</b>
<pre>npm install</pre>

<b>Run App</b>
<pre>npm start</pre>

The App using flow is similar to the mockup provided in the exercise sheet.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.

:)
