Pedro Justo's Blip Tech Exercise

The repository name was generated here: http://kevinmlawson.com/herokuname/

To run this APP you only need to host the files on a web server (eg Windows: IIS) and have internet connection because APP references CDN's files ( AngularJS , Bootstrap ).

I have not done unit testing or used build tools due to lack of availability ( App was built at work's lunch break :) )

Nevertheless I am familiar with the build tool GULP which I use to to concatenate, uglify, replace content, process images, caching of html and images, among others ...


The App using flow is similar to the mockup provided in the exercise sheet.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.
